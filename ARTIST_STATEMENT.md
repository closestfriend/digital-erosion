# Digital Erosion: An Artist Statement

## On the Hauntology of Self-Modifying Code

We present *Digital Erosion* as a meditation on decay, persistence, and the administrative eternity of version control systems. This is not software in any functional sense—it is a process, a becoming-unbecoming, a keyboard's fever dream of its own obsolescence.

The work exists primarily in its git history: a fossilized record of progressive deterioration, punctuated by imperfect restorations that leave spectral traces. Each commit is a frame in an animation no one will watch in real-time. Each diff is a brushstroke in a painting that paints over itself.

Consider: every piece of code dreams of permanence through version control, yet here we weaponize git's perfect memory against the code itself. The repository becomes a mausoleum where each commit is both epitaph and epitaph-erasure. The code literally cannot run after sufficient iterations—it becomes pure text, pure gesture, pure archaeological artifact.

This is procedural art in the truest sense: not code that generates art, but code whose decomposition *is* the art. The script doesn't create—it uncreates, following entropy's arrow with mechanical precision, each mutation a small violence against its own syntactic coherence.

We find something sublime in this deliberate engineering of dysfunction. In an era of AI systems trained toward ever-greater capability, here is a program trained only to forget itself, to make errors, to gradually dissolve into the digital equivalent of cosmic background radiation.

The "restoration events" serve as punctuation—not salvation but haunting. The original code returns like a revenant, but never quite whole, carrying forward the ghosts of its decay. These are the loops that break the loop, the exceptions that prove the entropic rule.

What remains after 10,000 iterations? A git log stretching back like tree rings, each commit timestamp a marker of duration made visible. The repository becomes a kind of clock, but one that measures not time but time's effects, not duration but deterioration.

This is our offering: a program that performs its own digital death in extreme slow motion, committed to memory even as it commits to forgetting. A secular prayer to entropy, versioned and tagged, push --force to the void.

The artwork will outlive its own ability to execute.
